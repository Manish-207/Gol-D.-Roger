                   He was the captain of the Roger Pirates, who held the title of Pirate King. He was executed in his hometown Logue Town, leaving the reason he is willing to be executed because he surrendered himself due to his terminal illness. 
                   <br><br>

                   His bounty was 5,564,800,000 Berrie. According to Brannew, his' and his arch foe, Whitebeard's bounties were unsurpassed. The World Government has covered up of Roger's real name and given him the name as Gold Roger. This was until Vegapunk revealed Roger's real name and being part of the D. clan to the entire world. According to Vegapunk, Roger and his crew knows the truth about the world but never took action against the World Government.
                   <br><br>

                <h4>Portgas D. Rouge</h4>
                Rouge was Roger's lover. It is unknown if they were ever married, nor how their relationship worked out, but she was seen crying when she learned of Roger's death from the newspaper. She died after Ace's birth due to a prolonged pregnancy, which lasted an unnatural twenty months in order to protect Ace from being hunted by the World Government, and also named their child "Gol D. Ace", proving that she wanted him to live up to his father's name

            <p>
                <h4>Portgas D. Ace</h4>
                Ace was the son of Roger. As Roger did not want his child to be born a criminal simply due to family ties, he requested Garp to take care of him in secrecy. When Roger spoke to Garp, he said that his unborn child held no sins. However, Ace did not see this as love and detested his father.

                Despite his hatred for his father, Ace seemed to have at least some respect for him, as he severely beat anyone who badmouthed Roger. However, this may have actually been due to the fact that said offenders often would begin slandering "the son of Roger", thereby unknowingly referring to Ace himself. Dadan noticed that Ace had inherited much of Roger's personality after asking him why he did not run from Bluejam. Also, Shanks remarks at the place of Ace's burial that he was the same as his captain, who would not run away, even in the most critical situations.The most prominent of the traits that Ace inherited from Roger was ruthlessness toward anyone who threatened or insulted his loved ones.

So, if you are interested in learning about the Roger Pirates crew members’ names, roles, and abilities, this guide is all you need.
